# NetrunnerBuilder
Script for outputing Android Netrunner Card Game deck sorted in a way matching my card collection organisation. Sample output of the script can be seen in the sample_output.csv file.

## Installation

You will need to download and install the following:
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/ - tested on 2.x, but 3.x probably should also run)
- OCTGN client (found in http://octgn.net/Home/GetOctgn)
- OCTGN Android Netrunner definition (http://octgngames.com/anr/)

Afterwards you need to adjust the file netrunner.py and set the set_root_dir const to point to your OCTGN Netrunner directory

You can change the ordering of sets by editing the set_groups const. Also you will need to edit this const when new data packs come out. Otherwise cards will be missing part of information and won' be correctly sorted.

## Running

To process your decks you will need to download ocgtn deck definition files (i.e. from netrunnerdb.com), put them to the folder with the script and name as follows:
- current_corp.o8d
- next_corp.o8d
- current_runner.o8d
- next_runner.o8d 

Then simply start the start.cmd file
