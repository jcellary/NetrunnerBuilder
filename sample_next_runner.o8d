  <notes><![CDATA[Exile and [Spark](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/35259/i-m-a-jerk-2nd-place-etx-regionals) got to 2nd place at the Seattle ETX regionals. I believe attendance was 40 players at ETX regionals. This is the continuation and modification of my original Dumpster Gambles deck that won a store championship last year.

With the hit from MWL the D4v1d had to come out, which made the deck a little less resilient, however, to deal with the big ice and make things a little more efficient I ended up going with the Panchatantra and Sharpshooters/Deus X.

This deck has not actually changed that much, the biggest issue is that I&#039;ve had to find room for all the 1-of silver bullets that really help in specific matches, like Artist Colony, Film Critic, Political Operative, and Plascrete.

Throughout the two day tournament, Exile only dropped a single game against 1st place&#039;s Sol. As for notable games, Imp continues to remain an MVP card, helping dismantle a Butchershop style NEH by trashing agendas and applying a lot of pressure on a 7-point CI game (Imp was recurred 4-5 times).]]></notes>
